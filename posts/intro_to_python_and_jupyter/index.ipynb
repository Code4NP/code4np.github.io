    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",

    "## What is a Jupyter Notebook? \n",
    "When people talk about processing scientific data, they rarely mean hitting a button on an automated system and waiting for a finished result. As you work through your hypothesis, you may often find that your question changes based on how the data come together. This is true of scientific coding as well. In practice, you will constantly be designing functions and need to evaluate how well they work - or troubleshoot why it does not run at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the tutorials we will be sharing will be written in Python - but that doesn't have to mean that we need to write a python script from scratch. What you are now reading is written in a Jupyter Notebook - a dynamic environment capabile of both processing code, and displaying results in a step-wise fashon. A Jupyter notebook is segmented, allowing you to write a specfic set of instructions in each cell and executing it to see the results without needing to re-run the entire script. From a practical perspective, you can think of a Jupyter notebook as a rapid prototyping sandbox. Once you have code that works as you expect, you can design larger applications that use the scripts you construct to automate a large protion of your processing tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives: \n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover:\n",
    "- The basics of coding in python\n",
    "- How to read in your data \n",
    "- Python packages (and why you should use them)\n",
    "- Designing your own functions (and why you'll need to)\n",
    "- Generate custom figures for presentations \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Case Study: \n",
    "\n",
    "We will search data from the NPAtlas to determine the number of reports of compounds per genus of bacteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an incredibly flexible programming language that allows you to design solutions to problems very quickly. Unlike more complex coding languages, you can create variables \"on the fly\" as you need them without declaring them at the very begining of the script. This allows you to pass data through these variables to other processes in a way that can be read easily by other processes. You may hear that python is \"slow\", but speed is rarely the main focus of designing a new tool in python. Because of it's simple structure and easy readability - it is often the go-to language for scientific programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Data Structures: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has some in-built structures for data that we will be using to store, sort, and manipulate our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings, Integers, and Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic data types we interact with in python are strings, integers, and floats. \n",
    "- Strings can be thought of as text and are surrounded by quotations so that python knows this is the kind of data we mean to provide. \n",
    "- Integers are whole numbers, and can be declared directly\n",
    "- Floats are numbers with decimals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be thought of the same in coding as they are in math, physics, or chemistry. Here, we can ascribe an attribute to a variable and call upon it later. Run the cell below by hitting shift+enter to execute the code outlined in the next block. "

    "\n",
    "### In-built Python Functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python contains a number of helpful functions that allow you perform all kinds of tasks and view the results. Basic math functions can be done directly, and you can view the answer by using the in-built  function. There are also tricks that you can use with functions such as combining variables and text in the print function.  "

    "Constructing a dictonary or list one element at a time can be useful - but very tedious. Often, we have excel spreadsheets or .csv/.tsv data files that contain the kinds of information we want to interact with. If you haven't worked with a .tsv file before - it is very similar to a .csv except that each value is separated by a tab instead of a comma. Although excel files are very human readable - they're very cumbersome for computation. TSV and CSV files are very efficent, and we can parse them using some in-built python functions. However, because python does not know that we will interact with a tsv or csv file, it has all of the functions we need to use tucked away to be more efficient. We can tell python to import this package so that we can fetch the data. \n",
