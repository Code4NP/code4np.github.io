## Summary
Chase is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he was awarded and partially funded by a T32 Fellowship in the [Computation and Informatics in Biology and Medicine (CIBM) training program](https://cibm.wisc.edu/). Chase completed a PhD in Pharmacognosy with [Dr. Brian Murphy](https://www.murphylabuic.com) at the University of Illinois at Chicago where he was awarded and funded by an [NIH F31 fellowship](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/training/ruth-l-kirschstein-national-research-service-award-individual-predoctoral-fellowship-f31)

Chase has >10 years of lab and computational experience surrounding natural products. Non-comprehensively, this spans analytical chemistry/biochemistry/microbiology method development and R&D at a small enzyme and probiotic manufacturer, to mass spectrometry method and software development in grad school, to engineering large scale genome mining and metagneomic software for drug discovery.

Chase would like to spend more time outdoors this year-- kayaking, scuba diving, cycling, etc.
