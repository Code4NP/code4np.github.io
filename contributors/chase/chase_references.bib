              from complex environmental and non-model host-associated
              microbial communities. Autometa has gained widespread use in a
              variety of environments and has been applied in multiple research
              projects. However, the genome-binning workflow was at times
              overly complex and computationally demanding. As a consequence of
              Autometa's diverse application, non-technical and technical
              researchers alike have noted its burdensome installation and
              inefficient as well as error-prone processes. Moreover its
              taxon-binning and genome-binning behaviors have remained obscure.
              For these reasons we set out to improve its accessibility,
              efficiency and efficacy to further enable the research community
              during their exploration of Earth's environments. The highly
              augmented Autometa 2 release, which we present here, has vastly
              simplified installation, a graphical user interface and a
              refactored workflow for transparency and reproducibility.
              Furthermore, we conducted a parameter sweep on standardized
              community datasets to show that it is possible for Autometa to
              achieve better performance than any other binning pipeline, as
              judged by Adjusted Rand Index. Improvements in Autometa 2 enhance
              its accessibility for non-bioinformatic oriented researchers,

              felix sponges, both of which are considered high microbial
              abundance (HMA) sponges that harbor similar bacterial
              communities. Overlap of metatranscriptional data on
              genome-resolved metagenomic data showed that genome bins
              classified within the Chloroflexota and Poribacteria phyla were
              the most abundant and transcriptionally active. However, abundant
              bins in general were not the most transcriptionally active,
              instead less abundant bins of the same phyla were most active
              indicating that numerical dominance does not imply
              transcriptional dominance. We found that although some primary
              metabolic functions appeared upregulated, they were not obviously
              attributable to any particular bacterial species. However,
              assessment of transcription levels of biosynthetic gene clusters
              (BGCs) encoding secondary metabolites revealed a high
              transcription of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally
              modified peptides (RiPPs) in genome bins across diverse bacterial
              phyla, most of which were likely srp RiPPs encoding brominated

              these compounds remains elusive. IMPORTANCE Marine sponges and
              bacteria have formed close associations over several million
              years with many bacteria performing specialized functions within
              their sponge host. Previous studies have either assessed the
              genomes of a given sponge or the expression profile for a sponge
              holobiont as a whole. Here, we present the first genome-resolved
              transcriptomic study which gives us a snapshot of the
              transcriptional activity of individual bacteria in the context of
              four different sponge holobionts. Using this approach we found
              that the numerically dominant bacteria were not the most
              transcriptionally active and that relatively high expression of a
              ubiquitous biosynthetic gene cluster was evident in many
              different bacterial phyla in all four sponge samples.",

  abstract = "Libraries of microorganisms have served as a cornerstone of
              therapeutic drug discovery, though the continued re-isolation of
              known natural product chemical entities has remained a
              significant obstacle to discovery efforts. A major contributing
              factor to this redundancy is the duplication of bacterial taxa in
              a library, which can be mitigated through the use of a variety of
              DNA sequencing strategies and/or mass spectrometry-informed
              bioinformatics platforms so that the library is created with
              minimal phylogenetic, and thus minimal natural product overlap.
              IDBac is a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based bioinformatics
              platform used to assess overlap within collections of
              environmental bacterial isolates. It allows environmental isolate
              redundancy to be reduced while considering both phylogeny and
              natural product production. However, manually selecting isolates
              for addition to a library during this process was time intensive
              and left to the researcher's discretion. Here, we developed an
              algorithm that automates the prioritization of hundreds to
              thousands of environmental microorganisms in IDBac. The algorithm
              performs iterative reduction of natural product mass feature
              overlap within groups of isolates that share high homology of
              protein mass features. Employing this automation serves to
              minimize human bias and greatly increase efficiency in the

               degree of variation of SM production within those taxa, is

               and SM profiles of hundreds of bacterial isolates from two

               demonstrated that within two sponge samples of the same species,

               thus researchers should scrutinize the isolates with analyses

              all microbial NP-inspired therapies can be traced to field
              expeditions to collect samples from the environment. Despite the
              importance of these expeditions in the search for new drugs, few
              studies have attempted to document the extent to which NPs or
              their corresponding production genes are distributed within a
              given environment. To gain insights into this, the geographic
              occurrence of NP ketosynthase (KS) and adenylation (A) domains
              was documented across 53 and 58 surface sediment samples,

              some libraries has resulted in unwanted natural product
              redundancy. In the current study, we implemented a workflow that
              minimizes both the natural product overlap and the total number
              of bacterial isolates in a library. Using a collection expedition
              to Iceland as an example, we purified every distinct bacterial
              colony off isolation plates derived from 86 environmental
              samples. We employed our mass spectrometry (MS)-based IDBac
              workflow on these isolates to form groups of taxa based on
              protein MS fingerprints (3-15 kDa) and further distinguished taxa
              subgroups based on their degree of overlap within corresponding
              natural product spectra (0.2-2 kDa). This informed the decision
              to create a library of 301 isolates spanning 54 genera. This
              process required only 25 h of data acquisition and 2 h of

              existing library based on the degree of metabolic overlap
              observed in natural product MS spectra of bacterial colonies
              (from 833 to 233 isolates, a 72.0\% size reduction). Overall, our

              phylogeny and specialized metabolite production of bacterial
              colonies growing on nutrient agar, we developed IDBac-a low-cost
              and high-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
              time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) bioinformatics
              pipeline. IDBac software is designed for non-experts, is freely
              available, and capable of analyzing a few to thousands of
              bacterial colonies. Here, we present procedures for the
              preparation of bacterial colonies for MALDI-TOF MS analysis, MS
              instrument operation, and data processing and visualization in
              IDBac. In particular, we instruct users how to cluster bacteria
              into dendrograms based on protein MS fingerprints and
              interactively create Metabolite Association Networks (MANs) from
              specialized metabolite data.",
